# RealEstateCompare
I have created this project from scratch, and will be using this GitHub repository to display my progress.

This project will use Trulia to compare the cost of single family homes in Northern Virginia (specifically Fairfax and Arlington counties, and the city of Alexandria).

Currently, this project produces a heat map of average house costs for the current market by zip code.   

I am currently working on instructions and notes for the project, which will go here! Check back for a finalized project in the next few weeks!
